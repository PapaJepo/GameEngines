For my Unity assignment I'm still a little unsure of what I want to do but I'm leaning more towards making a procedural creature of some kind.
I'm more inclined to choose this as I want to learn more about procedural animation and see it as a good asset for future projects.
I may also include some VFX as I was looking into them over the summer for projects like this.
Another idea I have is to make a procedural segment of a world tht you can traverse with some form of hoverbike or a fluid like control system.
My ideas may change over time bit I'm more than likely going to work on an idea related to either of the ideas Iv'e mentioned.
